# RandoDrum App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

## Testing

This project uses Vitest for testing. **Important**: Use `pnpm test:run` instead of `pnpm test` to avoid watch mode issues.

```bash
# Run tests once (recommended)
pnpm test:run

# Interactive test UI for debugging
pnpm test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

See [documentation/TESTING.md](./documentation/TESTING.md) for detailed testing guidelines.
