# Cursor Rules for RandoDrum

## Typography

ALL user-facing text MUST use the typographic apostrophe â€™ instead of the straight apostrophe '.

## Testing

- Use `pnpm test:run` for running tests (not `pnpm test` which uses watch mode)
- Watch mode can be resource-intensive and may cause issues in some environments
- Use `pnpm test:ui` for interactive debugging of failing tests
- Use `pnpm test:coverage` for coverage analysis before committing
